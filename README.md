# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Java. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. The players are represented by 'X' and 'O'. The game ends when one player achieves the winning condition or when all spaces on the board are filled, resulting in a draw.

This project serves as a learning exercise in Java programming, focusing on array manipulation, conditional statements, loops, and user input handling. It demonstrates basic game logic and control flow in a console-based environment.
